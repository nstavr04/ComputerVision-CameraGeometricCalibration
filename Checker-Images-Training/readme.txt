Here we will put the training images.
I tried to take pictures with rotation, tilt and a combination of both.
There's 25 pictures.

The assignment says that the automatic corner detection function should not recognize at least 5 images,
but from these images all of them are recognized (only 1 image I get a bit wrong points but still detected).
So I guess we will have to take 5 pictures a bit blurry or whatever so we manually calculate the corner points on those.
