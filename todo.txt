We need to differentiate the 3 runs on the offline phase. As it is now we just run through all 25 images.
We need to have 5 of the 25 images to not be recognized automatically (the corners) but manually. So far all 25 are recognized automatically.
We need to clarify when do we automatically recognize the corners and when we manually choose them.

Online phase works fine.

Need to see which of the CHOICE options we are doing.
